# strings.c
_A c-library for string operations_

---

**Disclaimer:** This is a work-in-progress. However, feel free to
take part in the development process.

I decided to create my own library for string operations, since I thought
it would be both fun and interesting, and since it will surely redeem itself
in future projects.
